Learning to code is as exciting as it is daunting, equal parts rewarding as terrifying. This multi-part series is meant to be used as a guide for those who are just entering, or are thinking about entering, the industry.

Whether you are making a career change completely, leveling-up in your current role, or maybe you are just frustrated, bored, or unhappy and you are considering **coding as a career** perhaps because you have heard it come up often, or maybe you have a friend or a friend-of-a-friend who does it - this is for you.

I always say the most valuable thing to someone who is learning to code is having someone who is already in the industry and who is able and willing to help steer you in the right direction. I did not have that person - and so I am going to try to give you the next best thing - a series that outlines common sense and incremental steps that you can take to gradually acquire knowledge and experience.

##### Where do I even start?

The hardest thing in the beginning of the **learning to code** journey is not knowing what you don't know.

Everything is going to look the same, every article will hold equal weight, every topic will seem just as necessary and overwhelming as the next.

Starting out like you are right now - we do not yet have the ability to discriminate between good information and bad information, information that is helpful and information that is not _yet_ helpful.

##### What to focus on first: HTML & CSS

The difference between learning to code today and learning to code 8+ years ago is the _barrier of entry_.

With the suite of build tools, utility libraries, UI frameworks and back-end choices now available to us and, in many ways, married to a modern web development workflow - that learning curve is steeper than ever.

Our first step is to begin at a place that the 'seniorest' of senior engineers today started with in the beginning of their careers: writing HTML and CSS to create webpages.

> It is critical that you allow yourself to be a beginner.

When all is said and done - at the end of the day, a web app is rendered using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We need to establish a strong foundation in two of the three front-end languages before moving on so that when we do focus on JavaScript - we can dedicate more headspace to that end since we have practiced and have a solid understanding of how and why HTML and CSS are behaving the way the do and what their role is in the front end ecosystem.

##### Next steps

1. Review Jeremy Thomas' awesome resource [Marksheet.io](https://marksheet.io). Start with reading the `Intro to the Internet`, which is a nice primer on how the internet works with browsers, domain names, etc. I suspect you will be surprised - as I was - by the extent to which you overestimate how much you knew about the internet. Simply because we use it everyday does not mean we know anything about the protocols and systems in place that make it happen.

  After that, I would review the section on HTML and CSS, as well. But don't spend too much time here as this is simply our first pass. You'll return and reference this resource many more times in the next steps.

2. Before actually starting to build anything - we need to first get you one of the most critical tools in a programmer's toolbox: a text editor.

  For now, I encourage you to download and use Visual Studio Code. Yes, it is made by Microsoft. And yes, it is one of the best text editors out there (and has quickly become the industry go-to). You can read more about it and download a copy for your Operating System(OS) [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

  The reason this step needs to come first before actually coding anything is because of what text editors give us the ability to do.

  ##### Why do we use text editors?

  While we could and can write our programs inside of a plain text editor like Notepad - we don't. And we don't because inside of Notepad, we - as authors of our program - are responsible for every single character we type. That opens up a ton of room for typos, syntax errors, misspellings, etc. - things that computer programs really care a lot about.

  So to make our lives easier, we use text editors which give us features such as:

    - file-extension-recognized syntax and color highlighting
    - indentation assistance / highlighting
    - tab completion (the editor intuitively completes the HTML tag that we start typing so that we don't have to type each character of the opening and closing tag, e.g. `a` becomes `<a href=""></a>` simply by typing `a` and then hitting the `TAB` key).

  Communication is paramount in coding. We write our code to be compliant with what the computer needs, but the code ultimately is not for the computer. The code is _for_ us.

  Syntax highlighting, code completion and other benefits of using a text editor (of which there are many more) help us write more efficient, more communicative code for ourselves, our team members and future versions of both as we reenter code bases again and again in the future. Writing code in this way is akin to giving a gift to your future self.

3. The best way to learn HTML and CSS is by building things. That is what I love about Shay Howe's _Learn to Code HTML & CSS_ book, which is completely available for free online [here](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/).

  There are two tracks: 1) An Intro course and 2) An Advanced HTML & CSS course.

  Your job is to dedicate time to completing both, first the intro, then the advanced course.

For now - that is plenty to get you started. We'll be back shortly with Part 2.

Good luck!
