## The Dreaded Float-based Layout

OK, so here's the deal. We don't really use floats anymore for building layouts.

Why?

First, they are difficult to understand and they are not fun to use (they _are_ fun to understand, though).

Second, using the `float` property to build layouts was a hack from the start. It took a thing that was never meant for layouts, and it was used in ingenious ways by the community _at the time_ to overcome layout challenges that were not possible in any other way.

Originally, floats were used to push an image to the right or left inside of a block of text, and the text would _float_ around the image, hugging the border of the image. This has its origins in _print design_. This behavior was hijacked in order to solve problems relating to layouts.

_So why should I learn how to use float-based layouts to begin with?_

If you learn float-based layouts - you can do anything.

> When I was 15 and learning how to drive, my parents insisted that I learn to drive _first_ with a car that had a manual transmission. Their reasoning was this: If you can drive a manual transmission vehicle now, then there will never be a car that you cannot drive. And in an emergency, you might need to know.

The same logic goes for floats. It is entirely possible that you will inherit a code base that uses float-based layouts, either throughout the entire project or in an isolated, perhaps legacy, portion of that codebase. And the day might come where you need to modify, enhance or revise that portion of the codebase. And in this case, you would not need to rely on anyone's knowledge or experience to help you because you understand how float-based layouts work.

## Building A Multi-Column Layout with Floats

This is what we'll start out with:

![float layout](./float-layout.png)

Here's how:

```html
<style>
  .row {
    width: 100%;
  }

  .column_one-third {
    width: 33.33%;
  }
</style>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column column_one-third"></div>
  <div class="column column_one-third"></div>
  <div class="column column_one-third"></div>
</div>
```

Because each `div.column` here has a `display: static;` by default, it will behave like a block element, taking up the entire width of the page regardless of the fact that we have set the width to 33.33%.

In order to get each column to sit next to one another side-by-side, _we could_ say:

```css
.column {
  display: inline-block;
}
```

...but that would only get us so far, since now only two of the three columns would be sitting next to one another. It is hard to see why our inline-block elements don't sit next to one another here because we have properly set the width on them to be exactly 1/3 of the width of the parent element - _yet_ they don't.

That is where floats come in.

Let's float our columns.

```css
.column {
  float: left;
}
```

When we float elements such as our `.column` elements, we are literally pulling that element or those elements _outside of the normal flow of the page_.

Because of this, the parent element - if it contains only elements that have been floated - collapses _as if it had no nested elements at all_. Here's a demonstration of that behavior:

![float animation](./floats-animation-loop.gif)

In order to _restore the natural flow of the page_, we need to `clear` out any floating behavior and let the browser know that, _Hey, it's cool, I know I messed with how you do things, but now I want you to resume from this point on as normal_.

A way to clear floating behavior - commonly referred to as a `clearfix`, can be done like so using a css `psuedo element`:

```css
.row:after {
  /**/
  content: '';
  display: block;
  clear: both;
}
```

> Notice that we apply to the clearfix on the _parent_ element that holds the elements that have been floated, not the floated items themselves.\*\*

The psuedo element of `:after` allows us to _programmatically insert_ an element via CSS into our page just before the closing tag of the parent. By inserting the element there, any floated items (and their floating behavior) that came before it inside of the parent element will be _cleared_ by our clearfix solution.

Stay tuned for Part 5 and 6 which will cover `flexbox` and `css grid` respectively.
